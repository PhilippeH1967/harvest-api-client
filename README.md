Harvest API client
================================================

A client for the Harvest API (getharvest.com) supporting OAuth2 authentication. It's inspired by https://github.com/lann/Harvest, but has some distinctions:

  * Supports Python 3x
  * Supports Oauth2
  * Has tests coverage

It doesn't support the basic authentication.
